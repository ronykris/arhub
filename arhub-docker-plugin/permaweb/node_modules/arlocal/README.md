# arlocal
Run a local Arweave gateway-like server.

## Usage
#### CLI Tool
Make sure you already have NodeJS + NPM installed.
To run `arlocal` it's as simple as doing an `npx` which means running the latest version available on `npmjs.com`.
```
npx arlocal
```
That's it! You are running a local slim gateway on `http://localhost:1984`

How about if I want to run it on another port?!
It's as simple as doing:
```
npx arlocal 8080
```
This will start arlocal on port `8080`.

Other options:
```
--hidelogs = This will hide the logs from ArLocal.
```

#### NodeJS library
You can also use `arlocal` as a library on your own code. This is useful if you want to make sure everyone who tests your app has this instance installed.

```
yarn add arlocal -D
```

Then you can import it just like any other node module:
```ts
import ArLocal from 'arlocal';

(async () => {
  const arLocal = new ArLocal();

  // Start is a Promise, we need to start it inside an async function.
  await arLocal.start();

  // Your tests here...

  // After we are done with our tests, let's close the connection.
  await arLocal.stop();
})();
```

The `ArLocal` class has a few options, all of them are optional.
```
ArLocal(port = 1984, showLogs = true, dbPath = '.db', persist = false)

port = What port to use for ArLocal.
showLogs = Should we show logs.
dbPath = folder where the db will be temporary stored.
persist = Whether or not data stored should be persisted among server restarts.
```

#### Sending transactions
Before sending a transaction to ArLocal, make sure you mint new AR tokens for the wallet you'll be using. This is done using the endpoint `/mint/<address>/<balance>`.

Sending a new transaction is done just like with the default gateway, use ArweaveJS to create your transaction, sign and post it.

After this transaction is sent, to confirm (`mine`) your transactions, you need to hit the `/mine` endpoint. You can do this programmatically or by simply going to `http://localhost:1984/mine`.

You can also mine more than one block at a time by hitting `/mine/{blocks}`, this will increase the current blocks to the set `blocks`.

## Features
- Extremely fast compared to other options out there.
- Community built, open source and free.
- No need of external resources, only NodeJS + NPM.
- Test transactions, SmartWeave Contracts, GraphQL requests, NFT deployment and more.
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and pretty much everywhere as long as NodeJS is installed.

### Contributing
PRs are greatly appreciated, help us build this hugely needed tool so anyone else can easily test their own transactions and SmartWeave contracts.

Before doing a PR, remember that if this is a route or an extisting feature of the gateway, you need to respect the same path/default of the existing mainnet gateway. Example: `/tx` should be kept as `/tx`, this is so the user doesn't have to do many changes for their unit tests, compared to normal transaction on mainnet.
